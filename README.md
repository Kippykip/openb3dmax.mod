openb3d.mod
===========

BlitzMax wrapper for Openb3d library version 1.1, an OpenGL 2.0-ready 3d engine based on Minib3d which is itself based on Blitz3D. As a result documentation is very good, help is available on the www.blitzmax.com boards and the source is regularly maintained.

The wrapper is object-oriented and also has a procedural interface like Blitz3D. Max2D is used for 2d-in-3d instead of attempting to port the 2d language set of Blitz3d. The coordinate system is flipped from the OpenGL orientation to be like Blitz3d so porting code will be easier. 

Several examples are included to get you started and extra features built in include: terrains, stencil shadows, particles, metaballs, md2 animation, shaders and access to framebuffer objects for post processing effects.
